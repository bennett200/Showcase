# Showcase is a store backend and frontend with complete crud functionality. Features Categories, Products, Orders, as well as an email section to send mass emails or to specific users. In the Orders section you can view the order items, Customer details,
and order details. If you click on the User email you can view the Customer's profile and past orders. To view the backend part of the store, you must have staff permissions. To view the store itself, click on the Store in the top right. The store also includes
a search bar. You can also contact the store. I previously had this set up with mailgun, but since this is only going on github, decided not to leave that. Click on the hire me or the LinkedIn icon at the bottom of the backend part of the store to view my LinkedIn
profile. Pushed with a sample database with products, categories and some orders already in place.
